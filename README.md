# Brain-Tumor-Detection

With this project I hope to be able to create a Machine learning model capable of detecting different tumors throuhg MRI Scan of our brain! This will not only be a great practice to using tensorflow but as well be able to have a contirbution to developing models capable of doing such work!

This is the data I used to complete this project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans?select=glioma
